# DYNAMIC FORM PRACTICE WITH REACT HOOK FORM V7

## REMEMBER THOSE TOPICS

1. AT FIRST YOU WILL IMPORT THE useForm AND useFieldArray FROM "react-hook-form"
2. THEN YOU WILL DISTRACT (handleSubmit , register, control) FROM useForm
3. THEN YOU WILL DISTRACT {append, remove, fields} FROM useFieldArray
4. THEN WE TURN THE map ON fields AND PASS ALL INPUTS INSIDE OF map
5. AND WE SET register METHOD INSIDE OF ALL INPUT'S EXAMPLE// {...register(`users.${index}.firstName`)}
6. WE WILL SET THE onSubmit AND remove AND addUser/addStudent
7. FINALLY WE APPEND AN OBJECT IN addUser/addStudent BY onClick METHOD WITH ALL INPUTS NAME EXAMPLE// append({ firstName: "", lastName: "", email: "", password: "", })
